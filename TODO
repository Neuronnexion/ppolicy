TODO list sorted by task importance
-----------------------------------
* test/cleanup LookupLDAP module
* timeout for request processing (kill "dead" connections)
* rewrite ppolicy.tools - these modules are poorly designed (e.g. dnsbl*)
* params for modules check method
* some code from start() should be moved to __init__()
* check escaping of incomming parameters in DB query
* IPv6 was not tested - don't use with mailserver that listen on IPv6
  (or don't use modules that work with client_address)
* database synchronization task (e.g. for greylist) between multiple mailgw
* caching in memory results of ListDyn
* remove log files after rotation - impossible with twisted log module
* stopping modules should be synchronized with check method
* make DNS check more robust in case of DNS server failure (timeouts)
* module which check information from whois (e.g. creation/change date)
* check results for updated spf.py module
* create "primary online" module (spammers try to use backup MX,
  so this module check if Primary is online...)
* RFC 3463 - Enhanced Mail System Status Codes

* automatic module tests
* Trap module is not fully tested
* DB synchronization
