TODO list sorted by task importance
-----------------------------------
* some code from start() should be moved to __init__()
* check resource leak(?) with new connection or dataProcess
* check escaping of incomming parameters in DB query
* split DnsblScore checking for client_address and sender
  for better cache usage
* resEx returned from check method can be complex structure
* IPv6 was not tested - don't use with mailserver that listen on IPv6
  (or don't use modules that work with client_address)
* database synchronization task (greylist)
* caching in memory results of ListDyn
* remove log files after rotation - impossible with twisted log module
* stopping modules should be synchronized with check method
* make DNS check more robust in case of DNS server failure (timeouts)

* automatic module tests
* DOS, Trap are not fully tested
* DB synchronization
