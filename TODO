TODO list sorted by task importance
-----------------------------------
* many of implemented modules doesn't make correct clean with stop()
  method - so restarting modules could now lead to undefined behavior
  (some parts of code should be moved from start() to __init__())
* error when using *args in check method ???
* caching in memory results from 'add/remove' method od ListDyn
* package dnsbl config files into RPM
* log files rotation

* automatic module tests
* DOS, List, Resolve, Trap are not fully tested
* DB synchronization

* config file grammar
