TODO list sorted by task importance
-----------------------------------
* many of implemented modules doesn't make correct clean with stop()
  method - so restarting modules could now lead to undefined behavior
  (some parts of code should be moved from start() to __init__())
* database synchronization task (greylist)
* caching in memory results from 'add/remove' method od ListDyn
* package dnsbl config files into RPM
* remove log files after rotation - impossible with twisted log module

* DOS - create cartesian product of required parameters
* automatic module tests
* DOS, List, Resolve, Trap are not fully tested
* DB synchronization

* config file grammar
