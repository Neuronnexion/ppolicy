Module Dnsbl
------------

Check if client address is listed in specified DNS blacklist.
see tools/dnsbl.txt for list of valid blacklist names - original
file can be downloaded from http://moensted.dk/spam/drbsites.txt
You can also run `python tools/dnsbl.py --list` to see formated
output of configured balacklists.

Parameters:
    cacheNegative (900)
        maximum time for caching negative result
    cacheUnknown (900)
        maximum time for caching unknown result
    factory (None)

    dnsbl (None)
        name of DNS blacklist defined in this module
    cachePositive (900)
        maximum time for caching positive result

Check arguments:
    data ... all input data in dict

Check returns:
    1 .... listed in dnsbl
    0 .... unknown error (e.g. DNS problems)
    -1 ... not listed

Examples:
    # check if sender mailserver is in ORDB blacklist
    define('dnsbl1', 'Dnsbl', dnsbl="ORDB")




Module DnsblScore
-----------------

Check if client address and sender domain is in various DNS
blacklists and make sum of scores that are defined in spamassassin
config files. Returned result depends on parameter treshold (this
module can return -1,0,1 or exact score if treshold is None).

This module use tools.dnsblScore.score to score mail. By default
it uses all available checks, but you can specify your custom by
listing their name in dnsbl parameter. You can list all valid
names by calling `python tools/dnsblScore.py --list`.

Parameters:

    cachePositive (900)
        maximum time for caching positive result
    treshold (None)
        treshold that define whitch score mean this module fail
    dnsbl (None)
        list of DNS blacklist to use

Check arguments:
    data ... all input data in dict

Check returns:
    1 (positive) .... score > treshold or positive score
    0 ............... unknown error (e.g. DNS problems)
    -1 (negative) ... score < treshold or negative score

Examples:
    # return blacklist score for client address
    define('dnsbl1', 'DnsblScore')
    # check if blacklist score for client address exceed defined treshold
    define('dnsbl1', 'DnsblScore', treshold=5)




Module DnsblDynamic
-------------------

Check if client address is in dynamic allocated ranges. It use
corresponding dnsbl and also domain name (e.g. format
xxx-yyy-zzz.dsl.provider.com).

There will by probably many "correct" mailservers sitting on IP
address from dynamic alocated space. Use the result as one of the
decision rule and don't reject mail only relaying on this result.

        list of DNS blacklists

Check arguments:
    data ... all input data in dict

Check returns:
    1 .... client address seems to be in dynamic ip range
    0 .... unknown error (e.g. DNS problems)
    -1 ... client address doesn't seem to be in dynamic ip range

Examples:
    # check if sender mailserver is in ORDB blacklist
    define('dnsbl1', 'DnsblDynamic')




Module DOS
----------

Limit number of incomming mail that has same parameters. You
can e.g. limit number of messages that can be accepted by one
recipient from one sender in defined period of time. It will
divide time interval into several parts and agregate information
about number of incomming mails. Be carefull setting this module,
because badly choosed parameters can exhause a lot of memory.

Some mail should not be blocked (e.g. to postmaster@your.domain.com,
from <>, ...) and your configuration should take care of it.

Parameters:
    cacheNegative (0)
        maximum time for caching negative result
    cacheUnknown (0)
        maximum time for caching unknown result
    limitGran (10)
        data collection granularity
    limitTime (3600)
        time period for limitCount messages
    factory (None)
        reference to factory instance
    params (None)
        parameters that will be used to test equality
    cachePositive (0)
        maximum time for caching positive result
    limitCount (1000)
        number of messages accepted during limitTime period

Check arguments:
    data ... all input data in dict

Check returns:
    1 .... frequency reached defined limit
    0 .... unrelated error (e.g. database problem)
    -1 ... frequency is acceptable

Examples:
    # limit number of mail from one sender to 1000/hod
    define('dos1', 'DOS', params="sender")
    # limit number of mail from one sender
    # and one mailserver to 100 in 10 minutes
    define('dos2', 'DOS', params=["sender","client_address"], limitCount=100, limitTime=10)

Module DumpDataDB
-----------------

Dump data from incomming request into the database. These informations
can be used to improve debugging of other modules or to gather
statistical data for further analysis. This module should be safe to
use in sense its check method doesn't raise any exception.

Module Greylist
---------------

Greylist implementation. Mail thats triplet (from,to,client)
was not seen before should be rejected with code 450 (temporary
failed). It relay on fact that spammer software will not try to
send mail once again and correctly configured mailservers must
try it one again (see RFC 2821).

Be carefull because some poorly configured mailserver did not
retry to send mail again and some mailing list has unique sender
name for each mail and this module delay delivery and increase
load of remote server.

Parameters:
    cacheNegative (0)
        maximum time for caching negative result
    cacheUnknown (0)
        maximum time for caching unknown result
    factory (None)

    expiration (2678400)
        expiration of triplets in database
    cachePositive (0)
        maximum time for caching positive result
    table (greylist)
        greylist database table

Check arguments:
    data ... all input data in dict

Check returns:
    1 .... was seen before
    0 .... some error occured (database, dns, ...)
    -1 ... Graylist in progress

Examples:
    # greylisting module with default parameters
    define('greylist1', 'Greylist')
    # greylisting module with own database table "grey", delay set
    # to 1 minute and expiration time of triplets to 1 year

Module ListDyn
--------------

This module provide general access (add/remove/check) to the
persistent data store in database. You can use this module for
black/white lists, persistent data cache for result from other
modules, ...

One of the most important parameter is "mapping". It is used to
map request parameters database columns. Its syntax is
[ 'dictName': ('columnName', 'columnType', escape), ...], where
dictName is attribude name comming in check method in data
dictionary, columnName is database column name, column type is
database column type in SQL syntax and escape is boolean value
that identifies text columns that's text should be escaped. If
don't define mapping for concrete column, than default is used
'dictName': ('dictName', 'VARCHAR(255)', True)

Second very important parametr is "operation". With this parameter
you specify what this module should do by default with passed request.
Also result returned from check method depends on this operation.
add ...... add new data to database
remove ... remove all matching data from database
check .... check if database include data from request

You can also set soft and hard expiration time for the
records. For example you can specify, that after 1 hour it will
return SOFT_NEGATIVE constant and after 2 hours
HARD_NEGATIVE. This can be usefull when you use this module as
persistent cache for some other module and you are not sure that
the its results are always reachable (e.g. when it uses DNS and it
is temporarly unreachable).

Parameters:
    cacheNegative (900)
        maximum time for caching negative result
    hardExpire (None)
        expiration time for the record (0 == never)
    softExpire (None)
        information that record will be soon expired (0 == never))
    mapping ({})
        mapping between params and database columns
    value (None)
        names of value columns (None mean no related data)
    factory (None)
        reference to factory instance
    cachePositive (900)
        maximum time for caching positive result
    criteria (None)
        names of input data keys used to identify data row(s)
    cacheUnknown (900)
        maximum time for caching unknown result
    operation (check)
        list operation (add/remove/check)
    table (list)
        name of database table where to search parameter

Check arguments:
    data ... all input data in dict
    operation ... add/remove/check operation that overide the default

Check returns:
    add, remove
        1 .... operation was successfull
        0 .... error (database error, ...)
    check
        2 .... parameters are in list, but soft expired
        1 .... parameters are in list
        0 .... failed to check (database error, ...)
        -1 ... parameters are not in list

Examples:
    # module for checking if sender is in database table list1
    define('list1', 'ListDyn', table='list1', mapping={ "sender": "mail", })
    # module for checking/getting if sender row values in database table list2
    define('list2', 'ListDyn', table='list2', mapping={ "sender": ("mail", "VARCHAR(50)", True), }, value=["data1"])
